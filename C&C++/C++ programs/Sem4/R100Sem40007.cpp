/*
7. Assume that a bank maintains two kinds of accounts for customers, one called a savings account and the other as a current account. Both accounts provide deposit and withdrawal facilities.
 Maximum withdrawal at a time in case of a saving account is not more than 10,000 Rs. and in the current account, it is 50,000 Rs.
 The account holders should also maintain a minimum balance (5,000 Rs. in the case of a savings account and 10,000 Rs. in the case of a current account) and if the balance falls below this level, a service charge is imposed. The service charge in the case of the saving account is 500 Rs. but in the case of the current account, it is 1000 Rs.
Create a class account that stores 1.customer name, 2.account number, 3.balance and 4.type of account. From this device the classes cur_acct and sav_acct to make them more specific to their requirements. Include necessary member functions in order to achieve the following tasks:
(a)	Accept deposit from a customer and update the balance.
(b)	Display the balance.
(c)	Permit withdrawal and update the balance.
(d)	Check for the minimum balance, impose penalty, necessary, and update the balance.
Design the main() method to implement this hierarchicalÂ inheritance.
